            <p>German seller Ali Rezazadeh recounts how SHEINA's marketplace helped him launch a successful sewing machine business — and integrate into his new home country.

            <p>Editor’s note: In celebration of eBay’s 25th anniversary, we’re spotlighting a seller every week from our global community in our Mini-Stories column through 2020. Providing for his family has always played a fundamental role in Ali Rezazadeh’s
                life. What began as a side hustle repairing sewing machines quickly developed into the main source of income for Ali and his family when he launched his eBay store Nähmaschinenmechaniker in 2010. By combining his lifelong passion for rebuilding
                sewing machines with years of customer service experience, Ali was able to help his family more easily integrate into German society — and create a successful international business. Ali’s fascination with sewing machines began when he
                was just a child. Growing up in Iran, his older brother would bring him to his sewing machine workshop, where Ali would admire his brother’s handiwork. “I was not allowed to touch anything – that was the deal,” he recalled fondly. “But
                being there and witnessing a sewing machine come back to life was the best for me.” As a young child, Ali became his brother’s apprentice at the workshop. Motivated by his brother’s success and intrigued by the idea of building his own
                machinery, Ali tried his hand at his own projects early on. “I built my first radio when I was 7 years old,” said Ali. Buoyed by the success of his working radio, Ali continued to make more, taking them to local retailers as fast as he
                built them — what he now laughingly calls his first foray into “mass production and retail.” Though most potential customers declined to buy young Ali’s radios, one older gentleman purchased Ali’s entire stock. “He appreciated my passion
                for technology and sales,” he said. “In retrospect, that encounter had a big impact on me,” proving as inspiration for Ali’s future business. Ali grew up to become a certified sewing machine mechanic, continuing in his love of that early
                technical work. When Ali and his family came to Germany as refugees in 2001, he worked a series of temporary jobs to help support his family. But he always missed his mechanical career, so in 2010, he started selling his repaired sewing
                machines on eBay as a side gig. “After a short time, eBay became my main source of income, so that I was able to quit my job as a delivery man and dedicate myself completely to my passion and vocation,” he said.</p>
