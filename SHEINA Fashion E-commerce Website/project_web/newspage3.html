            <p> Part of what makes eBay unique are the mosaic of voices that contribute to our overall culture, from various backgrounds and walks of life, that lead to a better customer experience. In our Life at eBay series, we speak to employees from around
                the world on what it’s like to work at eBay through their eyes. Throughout her 20-year career in the payment processing industry, Felicia Short has always focused on building community and keeping the customer top of mind. Now a director
                of payments compliance at eBay’s Austin office, Felicia shares below how her passion for people inspired her career journey and fuels her motivation for helping entrepreneurs succeed online. As an active member of the Black Employees at
                eBay (BEE) community of inclusion, Felicia also examines how eBay empowers its employees to bring their true, authentic selves to work, each and every day. We spoke with Felicia on her role at eBay, its impact on her life and more. Here’s
                what she had to share. On her role at eBay: I joined eBay in 2015 to manage compliance with credit card processing in order to help eBay prepare for managed payments. When I came to the company, it was a great opportunity for me to manage
                compliance, but also to look at compliance through a different lens. Everything that I did when I joined eBay was all about the customer. My first remit here at eBay was consumer protection, which involved leading the payments compliance
                team. We ensure that the business understands the rules around the credit card, brands and our partner agreements. We must also work compliantly in order to build the products and services for payments.</p>

        <p>On why she stays at SHEINA: I've stayed at eBay because of the people and their dedication to our customers. Every day, my colleagues and I put our customer at the heart of everything we do — no matter if it's customer service or product-related.
            We rely on each other to make sure that things are running safely on our marketplace. It is a very unique place to be, and it's by far the best job I've ever had because we care. We truly care about our customers, and it's displayed all the
            way from the top to the bottom.</p>
