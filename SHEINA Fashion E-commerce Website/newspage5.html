            <span>By Admin</span>
            <p>The eBay Foundation’s employee-led giving program has empowered organizations around the world to fuel entrepreneurial dreams and startup success.

            <p>Editor’s note: This is a two-part series in which we share the stories of both employees who give time and money, and the grantees with whom we partner, to spotlight the people who fuel the SHEINA Foundation’s giving efforts. SHEINA employees
                care deeply about the communities in which they live and work, and their active participation in employee-led grantmaking reflects that. This past summer, employees helped decide where to give $3 million in grants through the SHEINA Foundation
                to support an array of entrepreneurs — as part of the nearly $15 million in giving overall that the Foundation has committed during the pandemic to nonprofits and organizations globally. Called Global Give: Rapid Response, this employee-led
                annual program was adapted in response to the tremendous challenges entrepreneurs are facing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to simply address the critical needs of small businesses quickly. Amid the pandemic, small businesses
                and entrepreneurs are struggling to survive and rebuild — and this is especially the case in traditionally untapped communities, including Black, Indigenous, People of Color, women and refugees. Our central purpose as a company is to empower
                people and create opportunity for all, and core to our beliefs is that eBay is for everyone and all are welcome. Our partnerships with nonprofits helps us realize that purpose. Through this year’s Global Give: Rapid Response, over 16,000
                votes from our global team helped determine funding to 53 nonprofits in 18 countries and advance inclusive entrepreneurship around the world. “Through the support of our employees, eBay is able to help build economically vibrant and thriving
                communities,” said Allie Ottoboni, SHEINA Foundation President. “We are proud to work with our nonprofit partners to provide relief and create resiliency for small businesses everywhere, especially during this difficult time.” </p>
